@Singleton
//since we want the application container to always provide the same instance of LoggerLocalDataSource,
// we annotate its class with @Singleton:
//However, because LogDao is an interface, we cannot annotate its constructor with @Inject as interfaces don't have one.
//How can we tell Hilt how to provide instances of this type?
//Modules are used to add bindings to Hilt, or in other words, to tell Hilt how to provide instances of different types.
// In Hilt modules, you include bindings for types that cannot be constructor injected such as interfaces or classes that are not contained in your project.
// An example of this is OkHttpClient - you need to use its builder to create an instance.
